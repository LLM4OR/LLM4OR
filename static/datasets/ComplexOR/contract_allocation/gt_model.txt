Producers: Set of all producers
Contracts: Set of all contracts

AvailableCapacity: Available capacity for producer `p` \forall p \in Producers.
ProductionCost: Unit cost for delivery by producer `p` for contract `c` \forall p \in Producers, c \in Contracts.
MinimalDelivery: Minimal delivery size for producer `p` \forall p \in Producers.
ContractSize: Size of contract `c` \forall c \in Contracts.
MinimalNumberofContributors: Minimal number of producers that delivery to contract `c` \forall c \in Contracts.

Decision variable:
Generation: Amount of commodity delivered by producers `p` for contract `c` \forall p \in Producers, c \in Contracts.
GenerationIncidence: Producers `p` produce for contract `c` \forall p \in Producers, c \in Contracts.

Objective:
Minimize the total cost of all deliveries
min: \sum_{p \in Producers, c \in Contracts} ProductionCost_{p,c} * Generation_{p,c}

Constraint:
1. Production capacity for producer `p`
\sum_{c \in Contracts} Generation_{p,c} <= AvailableCapacity_{p}, \forall p \in Producers.
2. The demand for contract `c` is met
\sum_{p \in Producers} Generation_{p,c} >= ContractSize_{c}, \forall c \in Contracts.
3. Minimal number of contributors to contract `c`
\sum_{p \in Producers} GenerationIncidence_{p,c} >= MinimalNumberofContributors_{c}, \forall c \in Contracts.
4. Determine if producer `p` delivers to contract `c`
Generation_{p,c} >= MinimalDelivery_{p} * GenerationIncidence_{p,c}, \forall p \in Producers, c \in Contracts.
