We consider a general multi-level product structure with several end products. The external demand `Demand_{k,t}` for product `k` in period `t` is given and must be satisfied without backorders. For each product `k`, an initial inventory `InitialInventory_{k}` is given. Each product is produced on a single resource `j` with limited capacity `Capacity_{j,t}` per period, that can be extended by using overtime `Overtime_{j,t}`.
