Periods: set of time periods
Resources: set of resources
Products: set of products
ProductsPerResource: Set of products produced by resource `j`
Successors: Set of immediate successors of product `k`

RequiredUnits: Number of units of product `k` required to produce one unit of product `i` \forall k \in Products, i \in Products.
Capacity: Available capacity of resource `j` in period `t` \forall j \in Resources, t \in Periods.
BigNumber: a big number
OvertimeCost: Overtime cost per unit of overtime at resource `j` \forall j \in Resources.
HoldingCost: Holding cost of product `k` per unit and period \forall k \in Products.
SetupCost: Setup cost of product `k` \forall k \in Products.
ProductionTimePerUnit: Production time per unit of product `k` \forall k \in Products.
SetupTime: Setup time of product `k` \forall k \in Products.
InitialInventory: Physical initial inventory for product `k` \forall k \in Products.

Decision variable:
ProductionQuantity: Production quantity (lot size) of product `k` in period `t` \forall k \in Products, t \in Periods.
Inventory: Inventory of item `k` at the end of period `t` \forall k \in Products, t \in Periods.
Overtime: Overtime at resource `j` in period `t` \forall j \in Resources, t \in Periods.
SetupState: Binary setup state variable of product `k` in period `t` \forall k \in Products, t \in Periods.

Objective:
The sum of the setup, holding, and overtime costs.
min: \sum_{k \in Products, t \in Periods} (SetupCost_{k} * SetupState_{k,t} + HoldingCost_{k} * Inventory_{k,t}) + \sum_{j \in Resources, t \in Periods} OvertimeCost_{j} * Overtime_{j,t}

Constraint:
1. The inventory balance equations for period 2 to T-1
Inventory_{k,t-1} + ProductionQuantity_{k,t} - \sum_{i \in Successors_{k}} RequiredUnits_{k,i} * ProductionQuantity_{i,t} - Inventory_{k,t} = Demand_{k,t}, \forall  > 1, {k \in Products, t \in Periods.
2. The inventory balance equations for period 1
InitialInventory_{k} - \sum_{i \in Successors_{k}} RequiredUnits_{k,i} * ProductionQuantity_{i,1} - Inventory_{k,1} = 0, \forall k \in Products.
3. The production quantities and setup times meet the capacity constraints for all resources
\sum_{k \in ProductsPerResource_{j}} (ProductionTimePerUnit_{k} * ProductionQuantity_{k,t} + SetupTime_{k} * SetupState_{k,t}) <= Capacity_{j,t} + Overtime_{j,t}, \forall j \in Resources, t \in Periods.
4. A product can only be produced in a period if its associated resource is in the correct setup state
ProductionQuantity_{k,t} <= BigNumber * SetupState_{k,t}, \forall k \in Products, t \in Periods.
5. Initial value of inventory level
SetupCost_{i,0} = 0, \forall i \in I.
6. End period value of backlogging level
Capacity_{i,P} = 0, \forall i \in I.
