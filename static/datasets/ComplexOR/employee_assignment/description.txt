The Employee Assignment Problem is a scheduling problem where the goal is to assign employees to shifts in different restaurants based on their skills and preferences, while satisfying the demand for skilled employees in each restaurant. The objective is to minimize the cost of the schedule, which includes the cost of unfulfilled positions and the cost of assigning employees to less preferred positions.
