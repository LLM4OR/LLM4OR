This is a transportation problem where there are multiple origins (Orig) and destinations (Dest). Each origin has a certain supply and each destination has a certain demand. The goal is to minimize the total cost of transportation. The cost of transporting from an origin to a destination is given. The problem is subject to the constraints that the total supply from each origin and the total demand at each destination must be met.
