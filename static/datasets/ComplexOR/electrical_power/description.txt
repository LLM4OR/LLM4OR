In this problem, power generation units are grouped into three distinct types, with different characteristics for each type (power output, cost per megawatt hour, startup cost, etc.). A unit can be on or off, with a startup cost associated with transitioning from off to on, and power output that can fall anywhere between a specified minimum and maximum value when the unit is on. A 5-hour time horizon is with an expected total power demand for each hour. The model decides which units to turn on, and when, in order to satisfy demand for each time period. The model also captures a reserve requirement, where the selected power plants must be capable of increasing their output, while still respecting their maximum output, in order to cope with the situation where actual demand exceeds predicted demand.
