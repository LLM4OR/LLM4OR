The Main Facility Location model is a mathematical programming model that aims to optimize the location of facilities in a distribution system. The model considers different locations, commodities, product plants, distribution centers, and customer zones. It takes into account parameters such as supply, demand, maximum and minimum throughput, unit throughput cost, fixed throughput cost, and variable cost. The model includes variables to represent the shipment, selection, and service of commodities. It also includes constraints to ensure supply and demand balance, throughput constraints, and allocation constraints. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost of the distribution system.
