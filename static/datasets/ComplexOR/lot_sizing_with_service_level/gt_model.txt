Periods: Set of periods

Demand: Demand in period `t` \forall t \in Periods.
CostFixed: Fixed ordering cost in period `t` \forall t \in Periods.
CostUnitOrder: Unit ordering cost in period `t` \forall t \in Periods.
CostUnitHold: Unit holding cost in period `t` \forall t \in Periods.
Penalty: Unit backlogging penalty in period `t` \forall t \in Periods.
ServiceLevel: Predetermined service level

Decision variable:
OrderedAmount: Ordered amount in period `t` \forall t \in Periods.
EndingInventory: Ending inventory in period `t` \forall t \in Periods.
OrderIsPlaced: Whether order is placed in period `t` or not, i.e. OrderIsPlaced_{t} = 1 if an order takes place in period `t` and OrderIsPlaced_{t} = 0 otherwise \forall t \in Periods.
BackloggedAmount: Backlogged amount in period `t` \forall t \in Periods.
BackorderIsPlaced: Whether backorder is placed in period `t` or not, i.e. BackorderIsPlaced{t} = 1 if a backorder takes place in period t and BackorderIsPlaced{t} = 0 otherwise \forall t \in Periods.

Objective:
Minimize the total cost of all order lot size
min: sum_{t \in Periods} CostFixed_{t} * OrderIsPlaced_{t} + CostUnitOrder_{t} * OrderedAmount_{i} + CostUnitHold_{t} * EndingInventory_{t} + Penalty_{t} * BackloggedAmount_{t}

Constraint:
1. Flow balance in period `t` is satisfied
EndingInventory_{t-1} + OrderedAmount_{t} - BackloggedAmount_{t-1} - Demand_{t} + BackloggedAmount_{t} = EndingInventory_{t}, \forall t \in Periods.
2. Upper bound of order amount in period `t`
OrderedAmount_{t} <= OrderIsPlaced_{t} * sum_{i \in Periods} Demand_{i}, \forall t \in Periods.
3. Without loss of generality, the starting and ending stocks are zero
EndingInventory_{t} = 0, \forall  == 0 or t == P, {t \in Periods.
4. Without loss of generality for backlogging, the starting and ending backlogged amount are zero
BackloggedAmount_{t} = 0, \forall  == 0 or t == P, {t \in Periods.
5. Upper bound of backlogging amount in period `t`
 BackorderIsPlaced{t} * sum_{t \in Periods} Demand_{t} >= BackloggedAmount_{t}, \forall t \in Periods.
6. Maximum number of backorders
sum_{t \in Periods} BackorderIsPlaced_{t} <= ServiceLevel, \forall t \in Periods.
