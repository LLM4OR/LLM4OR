We consider the capacitated lot-sizing problem with setup times and lost sales, where `N` items have to be produced over a planning horizon of `T` periods. The discrete demand of each item `i` is given by `Demand_{i,t}` at period `t`. Each unit of item `i` produced at period `t` induces a production time `ProductionTime_{i,t}` as well as a fixed setup time `SetupTime_{i,t}`. We aim at finding an optimal production plan, i.e., a production plan complying with the capacity restriction for each period `t` while minimizing the total cost. This cost comprises the fixed and unitary production costs to be incurred each time a production takes place, the inventory holding costs for all the items, as well as the lost-sales costs penalizing the unsatisfied demand. The cost parameters are the unitary production cost `ProductionCost_{i,t}`, fixed setup cost `SetupCost_{i,t}`, unitary inventory holding cost `InventoryHoldingCost_{i,t}` for item `i` at period `t`, and the lost-sales cost penalizing each unit of unsatisfied demand of item `i` at period `t` defined by `LostSalesCost_{i,t}`.
