    Solve the capacitated lot-sizing problem with setup times and lost sales.

    Args:
        demand: 2D list of integers, demand[i][t] indicates the demand of item i at period t
        production_time: 2D list of integers, production_time[i][t] indicates the production time for one unit of item i at period t
        setup_time: 2D list of integers, setup_time[i][t] indicates the fixed setup time for one unit of item i at period t
        capacity: list of integers, capacity[t] indicates the capacity restriction for period t
        production_cost: 2D list of integers, production_cost[i][t] indicates the production cost for one unit of item i at period t
        setup_cost: 2D list of integers, setup_cost[i][t] indicates the fixed setup cost for one unit of item i at period t
        inventory_holding_cost: 2D list of integers, inventory_holding_cost[i][t] indicates the inventory holding cost for one unit of item i at period t
        lost_sales_cost: 2D list of integers, lost_sales_cost[i][t] indicates the lost sales cost for one unit of unsatisfied demand of item i at period t
        big_number: an integer, a large number used in constraints
