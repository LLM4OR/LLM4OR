We assume a production planning problem with a set of items (including finished goods, subassemblies, and raw materials), over time periods `Periods` and a set of machines and the underlying Bill of Materials (BOM). Each item has a manufacturing lead time and deterministic demand in each time period. The problem is to find production quantities in each time period that obey BOM requirements, demand requirements, limited capacity resources, and simultaneously minimizing the production and holding costs.
