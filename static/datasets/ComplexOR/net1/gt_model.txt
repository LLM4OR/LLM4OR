"Cities: a set of cities
Links: a set of links between the cities

Supply: amounts of goods available at city `i` \forall i \in Cities.
Demand: amounts of goods required at city `i` \forall i \in Cities.
ShippingCost: shipment costs one package from city `i` to city `j` \forall i \in Links, j \in Links.
Capacity: maximum number of packages that can be shipped from city `i` to city `j` \forall i \in Links, j \in Links.

Decision variable:
Ship: number of packages to be shipped from city `i` to city `j` \forall i \in Links, j \in Links.

Objective:
the total cost of shipping packages from the cities to the cities
minimize: \sum_{i \in Links, j \in Links} ShippingCost_{i, j} * Ship_{i, j}

Constraint:
1. the balance flow constraints for city `k`
Supply_{k} + \sum_{i \in Links, k \in Links} Ship_{i, k} = Demand_{k} + \sum_{k \in Links, j \in Links} Ship_{k, j}, \forall k \in Cities.
2. max packages that can be shipped from city `i` to city `j`
Ship_{i, j} <= Capacity_{i, j}, \forall i \in Links, j \in Links.
