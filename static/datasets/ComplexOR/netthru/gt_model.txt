Cities: a set of cities
Links: a set of links between the cities

Supply: amounts of goods available at city `i` \forall i \in Cities.
Demand: amounts of goods required at city `i` \forall i \in Cities.
Cost: shipment costs per ton over link `(i, j)` \forall i \in Links, j \in Links.
CityCapacity: maximum throughput at city `i` \forall i \in Cities.
LinkCapacity: maximum shipment over link `(i, j)` \forall i \in Links, j \in Links.

Decision variable:
Shipping: amount of goods to be shipped from city `i` to city `j` \forall i \in Links, j \in Links.

Objective:
the total cost of shipping goods over the network
min: \sum_{i \in Links, j \in Links} Cost_{i, j} * Shipping_{i, j}

Constraint:
1. the balance flow constraints for city `k`
Supply_{k} + \sum_{i \in Links, k \in Links} Shipping_{i, k} = Demand_{k} + \sum_{k \in Links, j \in Links} Shipping_{k, j}, \forall k \in Cities.
2. the shipment over link `(i, j)` should not exceed its capacity
Shipping_{i, j} <= LinkCapacity_{i, j}, \forall i \in Links, j \in Links.
3. the flow through city `k` should not exceed its capacity
Supply_{k} + \sum_{i \in Links, k \in Links} Shipping_{i, k} <= CityCapacity_{k}, \forall k \in Cities.
