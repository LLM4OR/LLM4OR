Locations: Set of locations/cities
Planes: Set of vehicles/planes types
Periods: Set of all periods

Capacity: Capacity of planes of type `v` \forall v \in Planes.
Cost: Cost of using planes of type `v` \forall v \in Planes.
AvailablePlanes: Available number of planes of type `v` \forall v \in Planes.
Delta: Binary parameter; 1, if there is flight depart from `i` in period `t` and arrive at `j` in period `h`; 0 otherwise \forall i \in Locations, t \in Periods, j \in Locations, h \in Periods.
NumberOfPassengers: Number of passengers for flight `(i, t, j, h)` \forall i \in Locations, t \in Periods, j \in Locations, h \in Periods.

Decision variable:
NumPlanes: Number of planes of type `v` departing from location `i` in period `t` and arriving at location `j` in period `h` \forall v \in Planes, i \in Locations, t \in Periods, j \in Locations, h \in Periods.
NumIdlePlanes: Number of planes of type `v` idle on ground at `i` just after period/event `t` \forall v \in Planes, i \in Locations, t \in Periods.
NumIdlePlanesInit: Number of planes of type `v` idle on ground at `i` just before the 1st period/event \forall v \in Planes, i \in Locations.

Objective:
The total cost of using the planes
min: \sum_{v \in Planes, i \in Locations, t \in Periods, j \in Locations, h \in Periods} Cost_{v} * NumPlanes_{v, i, t, j, h}

Constraint:
1. Flow balance for number of planes for each location and period
NumIdlePlanesInit_{v, i} = NumIdlePlanes_{v, i, 1} + \sum_{j \in Locations, h \in Periods} NumPlanes_{v, i, 1, j, h}, \forall v \in Planes, i \in Locations.
2. Flow balance for number of planes for each location and period
NumIdlePlanes_{v, i, t} = NumIdlePlanes_{v, i, t-1} + \sum_{j \in Locations, p \in Periods} NumPlanes_{v, j, p, i, t} - \sum_{j \in Locations, h \in Periods} NumPlanes_{v, i, t, j, h}, \forall  > 1, {v \in Planes, i \in Locations, t \in Periods.
3. Cannot use more planes than what we have in fleet
\sum_{i \in Locations} NumIdlePlanesInit_{v, i} <= AvailablePlanes_{v}, \forall v \in Planes.
4. Capacity on flight `(i, t, j, h)` must cover its demand
\sum_{v \in Planes} Capacity_{v} * NumPlanes_{v, i, t, j, h} >= NumberOfPassengers_{i, t, j, h}, \forall i \in Locations, t \in Periods, j \in Locations, h \in Periods.
5. Restrict the NumPlanes variables on routes with no scheduled flights
NumPlanes_{v, i, t, j, h} <= AvailablePlanes_{v} * Delta_{i, t, j, h}, \forall v \in Planes, i \in Locations, t \in Periods, j \in Locations, h \in Periods.
