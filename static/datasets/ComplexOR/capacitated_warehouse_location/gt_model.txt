Locations: set of potential locations
Customers: set of customers

Demand: demand of customer `j` \forall j \in Customers.
AllocationCost: allocation cost of customer `j` to location `i` \forall i \in Locations, j \in Customers.
Capacity: capacity of location `i` \forall i \in Locations.
FixedCost: fixed cost of opening location `i` \forall i \in Locations.

Decision variable:
DemandFractionSupplied: demand fraction supplied from location `i` to customer `j` \forall i \in Locations, j \in Customers.
Open: binary decision of opening location `i`. If opening, equal to 1; otherwise 0 \forall i \in Locations.

Objective:
summation of allocation costs and fix costs
min: \sum_{i \in Locations, j \in Customers} AllocationCost_{i,j} * DemandFractionSupplied_{i,j} + \sum_{i \in Locations} FixedCost_{i} * Open_{i}

Constraint:
1. constraints of satisfying demand
\sum_{i \in Locations} DemandFractionSupplied_{i,j} >= 1, \forall j \in Customers.
2. the total amount of supply can not exceed the capacity of warehouse in location `i`
\sum_{j \in Customers} Demand_{j} * DemandFractionSupplied_{i,j} <= Capacity_{i} * Open_{i}, \forall i \in Locations.
3. Effective Capacity
DemandFractionSupplied_{i,j} * Demand_{j} <= Capacity_{i} * Open_{i}, \forall i \in Locations, j \in Customers.
