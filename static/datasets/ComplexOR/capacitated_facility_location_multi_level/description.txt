We make the following assumptions in defining and formulating the Capacitated Multi-level Lot Sizing Problem (ML-CLSP). First, we assume that setup times and costs are non-sequence dependent, setup carryover between periods is not permitted, and all initial inventories are zero. Second, all production costs are assumed to be linear in production output and do not vary over time; hence, they can be dropped from the model for simplicity. Setup and holding costs are also assumed not to vary over time. Furthermore, end items are assumed to have no successors, and only end items have external demands and backlogging costs. Finally, we assume zero lead times and no lost sales. It is important to note that all these assumptions (except setup carryover) are made for ease of exposition only and without loss of generality, i.e., the theoretical results remain valid even when they are removed. See Ozturk and Ornek (2010) for the lot-sizing problem with setup carryover as well as with external demands for component items.
