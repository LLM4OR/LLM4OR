{"en_answer": "9337440", "difficulty": "Hard", "en_question": "For manufacturing companies, it is important to develop appropriate production plans and human resource management strategies to reduce operating costs, inventory costs, stockout costs, and labor costs. In particular, for products with high demand fluctuations, companies need to accurately forecast demand and develop corresponding production plans. A company produces a folding table, with a raw material cost of 90 yuan per unit and 5 labor hours. The unit price of the product is 300 yuan. At the beginning of January, the company has 1000 workers and holds 15,000 units of inventory. The normal wage for workers is 30 yuan per hour, and the normal working hours per worker per day is 8 hours. Overtime hours are paid at an hourly rate of 40 yuan. The number of working days per month is calculated as 20 days. Assuming the company has sufficient available production machines and its production capacity is not limited by machine hours. The overtime hours per worker per month do not exceed 20 hours. Holding inventory incurs corresponding inventory costs. If there is a stockout due to insufficient capacity, there will be certain stockout costs. In addition, the company can make up for the shortage through outsourcing. The outsourcing cost per unit, monthly inventory cost, and monthly stockout cost are 200 yuan, 15 yuan, and 35 yuan, respectively. The company's employees are all temporary workers, and the company can flexibly decide the number of employees to hire and dismiss each month. The cost of hiring and dismissing a single employee is 5000 yuan and 8000 yuan, respectively. Assuming the company has used existing forecasting models to predict the demand from month 1 to month 6, as shown in Table 4.1.\n\nTable 4.1: Demand Forecast\n\n| Month | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Demand Forecast | 20000 | 40000 | 42000 | 35000 | 19000 | 18500 |\n\nPlease develop a production plan, worker schedule, and plan for hiring and dismissing employees for the company to maximize its total net profit over 6 months, while ensuring that the company holds at least 10,000 units of product by the end of June.", "question_type": "MIP"}
{"en_answer": "1644.63", "difficulty": "Hard", "en_question": "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) was first proposed by Dantzig in 1959 (Dantzig and Ramser 1959). It is a very classic combinatorial optimization problem. The basic VRP can usually be described as follows: in a certain area, there are a certain number of customers and a distribution center or warehouse. The customers are generally distributed in different locations, and each customer has a certain amount of goods delivery demand. The distribution center or warehouse needs to dispatch a fleet of vehicles and design a suitable delivery plan to fulfill all customer's goods delivery demands. The objective of VRP is to maximize efficiency while meeting all customer demands. The measurement of efficiency is usually presented in the form of an objective function. The objective function varies with the company's requirements, and common objective functions include minimizing the total distance traveled by vehicles, minimizing the total delivery time, and minimizing the number of vehicles used, etc. In addition to meeting customer delivery demands, VRP generally needs to consider various other constraints, resulting in various variants. For example, if the vehicle's load cannot exceed its maximum capacity (capacity constraint), the problem becomes the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). If the delivery demand of each customer must be delivered within a specific time window, the problem becomes the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW).\n\nThe Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is a classic problem developed from VRP. There are many applications of VRPTW in reality, and each customer point generally has a service time window. For example, some logistics centers need to deliver packages during low-traffic hours, some large supermarkets need to restock during non-business hours, and real-time delivery methods such as food delivery require specific delivery time windows. Time windows can be classified as hard time windows and soft time windows. Hard Time Windows (HTW) means that vehicles must arrive at or before the time window, and cannot delay their arrival. If they arrive early, they must wait until the time window starts to provide service, such as restocking supermarkets and delivering goods from logistics centers, etc. Soft Time Windows (STW) means that vehicles are not required to arrive within the original hard time window, but they should try to arrive within the hard time window. If the vehicle arrives early, a penalty value will be deducted, and if it arrives late, a certain penalty value will be imposed, such as food delivery, school bus pick-up and drop-off, industrial distribution, etc.\n\nThe Vehicle Routing Problem with Hard Time Windows (VRPHTW) can be described as follows: there are a certain number of customer points and a distribution center in the region. Vehicles need to depart from the distribution center and return to the distribution center. The route should be continuous, and each customer should be served by one and only one vehicle. The vehicles also have a capacity. Each customer has a specific service time window and can only be served within the time window. Vehicles can arrive at the customer point ahead of time and wait for the time window to open, then provide service to the customer. They can also arrive at the customer point within the time window to provide service. Vehicles can only start serving customers within the time window, and the service time is known. The distribution center needs to arrange a reasonable delivery plan to both complete the delivery tasks and minimize travel costs. VRPHTW, like VRP, mainly emphasizes the travel costs on the routes because delays are not allowed. Now, please model the VRPHTW in operations research.\n\n### Example\nr101.txt = r\\\"\"\"\n    0          35      35           0       0         230           0\n    1          41      49          10

{"en_answer": "40", "difficulty": "Hard", "en_question": "As one of the main arteries of urban transportation, the city subway carries a huge passenger flow and its operation and management are very complex. Among them, crew scheduling is one of the key links in subway operation management and also the starting point and difficulty of crew management. The subway transportation volume is large, with complex and changing routes, and frequent operation intervals. Crew drivers face huge, continuous, and high-intensity transportation tasks. It is important to arrange the driver's shift and duty mode reasonably and achieve the optimal allocation of personnel to ensure the efficient and stable operation of the subway. Due to the increasing complexity of the subway operation network, traditional manual scheduling methods can no longer meet the high standard operation requirements. Automated and intelligent crew scheduling has become an inevitable trend.\n\nThe general process of crew scheduling for subway operating companies is as follows: export train operation section and time information tables based on the current operation chart, manually divide the crew duty roster based on these information tables, compile the crew scheduling master table based on the duty roster, and finally allocate the crew groups based on the scheduling master table to form the final scheduling table. The entire process relies on manual compilation and mainly has the following three major problems:\n\n1. Low scheduling efficiency: Crew scheduling business rules are complex, and the workload is large. The efficiency of manual compilation is very low, requiring at least one week. The manpower and time costs are high.\n\n2. Difficulty in adjustment: When encountering unexpected situations such as train failures and temporary leave of crew members, it is difficult to quickly adjust the scheduling plan based on manual methods, affecting the efficiency of operation management.\n\n3. Uneven task assignment: Manual scheduling has subjective limitations and strong dependence on human experience. If the scheduling is unreasonable, it may lead to uneven task assignment, unfair scheduling, and low crew satisfaction.\n\nThis subway line includes 40 platforms, among which A, M, and Z platforms are available for driver transfers and handovers. Please consider 200 driving tasks and their attributes such as time, location, and mileage, and consider classic constraints in crew scheduling scenarios, such as maximum continuous driving time constraint, mileage limit constraint, attendance location constraint, etc. Compare different mixed integer modeling methods to minimize the number of drivers as the goal and output the optimal task chain combination (i.e. the allocation and connection relationship of all tasks) for all tasks.\n\n### Example\nMileage Information Table.csv = \\\"\"\"\nDeparture Station,Arrival

{"en_answer": "85", "difficulty": "Easy", "en_question": "Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Specific Values\\n\\nThe famous traveling salesman problem in operations research can be described as follows: a traveling salesman starts from a certain city and goes to visit other \\( n \\) cities to sell goods. It is required to visit each city exactly once and then return to the original starting city. The distance between city \\( i \\) and city \\( j \\) is given as \\( d_{ij} \\). What kind of route sequence should the salesman choose to minimize the total travel distance?\\n\\nWe will establish an integer programming model for this problem using specific values for the number of cities and distances between them. Let's assume there are 5 cities (including the starting city) and the distance matrix \\( D \\) is given as follows:\\n\\n\\[\\nD = \\begin{bmatrix}\\n0 & 10 & 15 & 20 & 25 \\\\\\n10 & 0 & 35 & 25 & 30 \\\\\\n15 & 35 & 0 & 30 & 20 \\\\\\n20 & 25 & 30 & 0 & 15 \\\\\\n25 & 30 & 20 & 15 & 0\\n\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\", "question_type": "IP"}
